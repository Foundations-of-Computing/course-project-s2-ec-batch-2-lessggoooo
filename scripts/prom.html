            CET College, February 12: Love was in the air as CET College hosted its much-anticipated Prom Night on the evening of February 12th, celebrating the essence of Valentine’s Day. The event, which began at 7:00 PM, was a dazzling spectacle filled with romance, fun, and unforgettable moments.
            
            The program featured a series of engaging activities, including couple dance, couple games, musical performances, and other exciting events, all designed to set the perfect romantic ambiance. The entire college gathered to witness the grand event, creating a huge crowd of enthusiastic students eager to experience the enchanting night.

            For the singles in the audience, the event was both an inspiration and a tease. The sight of happy couples enjoying the night together sparked a mix of emotions—some laughed, some wished for their own love stories to begin, and others humorously vowed to find their "soulmate" before next year’s Prom Night.
